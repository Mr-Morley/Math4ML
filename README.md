## Disclaimer
As we navigate through this mathematical maze, expect to find:
- **Expanded Tutorials**: Not just following along, but adding our own twists and turns.
- **Creative Experiments**: What happens if we tweak this? How does that change the outcome?
- **Personal Insights**: Sharing those "Aha!" moments that textbooks just can't capture.# Mathematics For Machine Learning - Personal Exploration


# Most Importantly!
This repository is a personal fork of the [mml-book.github.io](https://github.com/mml-book/mml-book.github.io) repository, which is the companion webpage to the book "Mathematics For Machine Learning" by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong, to be published by Cambridge University Press.

The content of the original work is aimed at providing the necessary mathematical skills to read advanced machine learning literature, divided into two main parts: Mathematical foundations and example machine learning algorithms that utilize these foundations.

## Purpose of This Fork

The purpose of this fork is to personally explore, work through, and possibly expand upon the tutorials and exercises provided in the original repository. This effort is for educational purposes, meant to deepen my understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning algorithms.

## Original Work and Authors

All original content, including the structure, tutorials, and exercises, is credited to Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong. The comprehensive details about their work and the book can be found at [https://mml-book.com](https://mml-book.com).

## Content and Modifications

This fork may contain personal notes, additional comments, and expanded examples or exercises based on the original tutorials. The primary goal is to enhance my learning experience and document my journey through the mathematical landscape of machine learning.

### Tutorials

The original repository provides Jupyter notebooks for hands-on tutorials, which can be run live on Binder or directly on Google Colab. Here is a list of some of the tutorials included:

- Linear Regression
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

## Acknowledgements and Copyright

I extend my sincerest gratitude to the authors, Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong, for creating this invaluable resource and making it openly available. The original work is copyrighted by the authors and is set to be published by Cambridge University Press.
